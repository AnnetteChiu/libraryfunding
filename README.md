# libraryfunding
Where America’s libraries are located. Where there are gaps and clusters.
    Within the urban, rural, suburban distinctions, where we see comparative density or scarcity.
    Look at the outliers and whether they are supported
    Library attributes:
    What hours are they open?
    Are they partnering with schools?
    Do they have outreach services?
    What is the population of their service areas and how does it compare to cardholders?
    Where is there fast broadband access and where isn’t there?
    How many people are not currently served by a library –where don’t we have coverage? 
    Where has theoretical coverage but is underserved?
    What is their governance structure?
    What is their budget?
    Library advocacy efforts:
Where have they tried to pass a referenda or library budget, and were they successful? What other electoral data do we have on those places—party membership? Voter turnout?
Overlay with proximity to other community anchors: post offices, schools, community center, city hall, courthouses, colleges and universities, bookstores, parks?
